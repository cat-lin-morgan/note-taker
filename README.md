# Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

This was a project to write backend code using Express.js. We used the GET, POST, DELETE, USE, and ROUTER that Express.js supplies us with. As well as the fs Module that Node supplies us with.

**Extra:** I decided to try the delete notes bonus, it was hard, but I think I figured it out ok.  It was a ```router.delete``` and some tricky logic that exists in my lib/notes.js, along with the POST logic. 

**Other:** For the unique id I went with the npm [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid "Unique ID npm").
